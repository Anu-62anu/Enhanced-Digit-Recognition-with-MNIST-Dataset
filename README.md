# Enhanced-Digit-Recognition-with-MNIST-Dataset

This project involves classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using various machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed with feature extraction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis). Several classifiers are evaluated, including SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The project also includes ablation studies with different k-fold cross-validation strategies and demonstrates prediction on new digit images.
